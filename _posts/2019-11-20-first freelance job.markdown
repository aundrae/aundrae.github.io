Last month I received my first freelance job to build a mobile application for a fitness trainer. The client needed an app to facilitate playing videos involving training specific parts of the body, diet plans, training plans, allow users to communicate with the client directly, allow users to create a profile to have them update their body stats weekly and restrict users from feaures until they become a paid subscriber.

In the beginning, the development was a little complicated with regards to what tools should be used (database type, frontend hosting and backend hosting, video player) to develop the app becuase the client did not have the funds to handle maintenance costs. After some heavy research to find suitable technologies to delop this app, the following were used:

- Ionic
- Express
- Firebase(Firestore, Authentication, Hosting)
- JW Player (Paid Subscriber Videos)
- Dailymotion Player (Free Subscriber Videos)
- Heroku

Also, the price to have the app on the Apple App Store was too expensive for the time so the app is a PWA therefore eliminating thr need to for both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store until the client is ready to port it to the respective stores. Since the Ionic Framework is being used to develop this app, porting it to android and ios app store is done by running one command each :D.
